                <p>
                    To return items via USPS, use the self-adhesive return label
                    included in your parcel. This label is pre-paid and
                    pre-addressed. The return shipping fee of $5.99 will
                    automatically be deducted from your refund. If you are an
                    H&M Loyalty Member, the return shipping fee will be waived.
                    If you have used or lost the pre-paid return label or the
                    Return Form, please contact us.

                <p>
                    If you do not wish to use the pre-paid return label, we
                    recommend that all returns be sent with a traceable carrier
                    such as USPS, UPS or FedEx. Keep the Return Tracking Number
                    from the package you are returning to ensure that the
                    package has been delivered to our warehouse. H&M is not
                    responsible for any packages sent with a return label not
                    provided by H&M. H&M does not accept C.O.D. deliveries.

                <p>
                    If you paid using a physical H&M Gift Card or H&M e-Gift
                    Card, all refunds will be issued to a new H&M e-Gift Card

                    For example, you placed an order totaling $100, and you paid
                    $25 with an H&M Gift Card and $75 with a credit card. You
                    decide to return $50 worth of items. We will refund $25 to
                    an H&M e-Gift Card and $25 to the credit card used at
                    purchase.
